# Arch-Deflection-Analysis
This repository contains Python-based analysis of lab deflection tests on 10 arches made in China using AMO and ASTM methods. Each arch was measured at 24 angles with 5 trials. The workflow includes statistical summarization, harmonic modeling, phase alignment, and visualization with confidence intervals to study directional deformation patterns.
